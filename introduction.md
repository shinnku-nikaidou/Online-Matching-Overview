# Introduction

A matching is a graph $$G(V,E)$$ is a set of edges $$M \subset E$$ such that for every $$v \in V$$ , there is at most one edge in $$M$$ incident on $$v$$.&#x20;

A maximum matching is a matching with the largest size.



### Background and Applications of Matching

1. two-sided market
2. stable matching or a Pareto efficient in a graph
3. hospitals (even kidney donors to recipients)

#### In computer science

1. Networking: switch scheduling algorithm in input queued (IQ) switch architectures
2. the scheduling and Operations Research literature
3. algorithms in TCS.
